# Tech For Palestine

Inexplicably I now help lead a Palestinian advocacy org called [Tech For
Palestine](https://techforpalestine.org), which I founded with a core group of
about 40 others.

# Darklang

I've been working on Darklang since late 2016. I'm taking a hiatus to work on Tech For Palestine. You can follow that work in various places:

- [Darklang blog](https://blog.darklang.com),
- [changelog](https://docs.darklang.com/changelog),
- [Discord](https://darklang.com/discord-invite), and [mailing
- list](https://darklang.com/mailing-list)

# Past self

I previously was founder and CEO of [CircleCI](https://circleci.com). I wrote a
bunch of early stuff on the CircleCI blog, including [this
piece](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20future%202015%2D06%2D09)
that I'm extremely proud of.

I also did a PhD in Compilers and Static Analysis, and [my research papers](https://paulbiggar.com/research) are online (also includes some research on sorting algorithms)
